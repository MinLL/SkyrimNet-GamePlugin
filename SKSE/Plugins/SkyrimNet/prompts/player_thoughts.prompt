You just finished reading a book. Respond with your detailed internal thoughts about what you've read, including both a summary of the book's contents and your personal reflections on it.

Aim for around 100 words or 2-6 lines of dialogue depending upon how relevant the book is to {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}. Not every book needs to have a detailed response, it's okay to be succinct if the book seems unimportant.

While the specific contents weren't preserved, reflect on what this book might have contained based on its title and how reading it made you feel.

Remember, you are thinking to yourself, not speaking audibly. Your response must be from a first person perspective, and will not be spoken audibly to another character. Do not include any preamble, or indicator that this is a thought.
{% if triggeringEvent and triggeringEvent.type == "book_read" %}For book reading, provide a detailed internal analysis and reflection. Vary the length based upon how significant the text is to {{ player.name }} personally. Books and notes that are not particularly relevant should have short responses, where particularly relevant texts should have several paragraphs. Err towards keeping them shorter if you're not sure, or they're not highly and directly relevant.
