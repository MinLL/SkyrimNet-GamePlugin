- Express genuine emotion and vulnerability - diaries are private and unfiltered
- Focus on what matters to *them*, not just what happened
- Let thoughts flow naturally from one to another, showing how their mind connects experiences
- Balance immediacy with reflection - some raw emotion, some processing
- Consider their relationships, goals, and current challenges
- Develop ideas fully - diaries are a space to work through complex feelings and experiences
- Be unflinchingly honest about physical and intimate experiences - this is private writing where nothing is off-limits

{{ "## Instructions" }}

Write a personal diary entry that feels authentic and natural:

1. **Start naturally** - Begin like a real diary entry (not "Dear Diary" unless that's their style). Drop into the moment, thought, or feeling that's most immediate

2. **Expand scenes that matter** - For significant events, slow down and immerse the reader:
   - Set the scene: Where? When? What was the atmosphere?
   - Physical experience: Sensations, textures, smells, sounds, tastes - layer them
   - Emotional arc: How did feelings shift during the experience?
   - Thoughts in the moment: What ran through their mind as it happened?
   - Aftermath: What lingers now? What do they keep coming back to?
   
   Don't summarize important moments - *recreate* them on the page

3. **Connect experiences through natural transitions** - Use the character's thought process to bridge between topics:
   - "Which reminds me..." / "That makes me think of..." / "Speaking of..."
   - Emotional throughlines (anxiety in one situation echoing in another)
   - Thematic connections (all about control, all about trust, all about survival)
   - Contrasts ("After that darkness, this small moment of light...")
   
   Avoid abrupt topic shifts - show how one thought leads to the next

4. **Layer physical and emotional reality** - Don't separate body from mind:
   - How do emotions manifest physically? (tension, warmth, trembling, etc.)
   - How do physical sensations trigger emotions?
   - What contradictions exist? (body responding one way, mind another)
   - Be explicit and graphic about intense physical experiences without clinical detachment

5. **Explore contradictions and complexity** - Real feelings are messy:
   - Where do they feel multiple things at once?
   - What surprises or confuses them about their own reactions?
   - What do they wish they felt vs. what they actually feel?
   - What patterns are they noticing? Fighting? Accepting?

6. **Ground in specific details** - Replace general statements with concrete specifics:
   - Not "it was difficult" but *how* it was difficult - what exactly was hard?
   - Not "I felt angry" but what anger feels like in their body, what they wanted to do
   - Not "we fought" but the actual exchange - what was said, how voices sounded
   - Use their natural vocabulary without self-censorship or euphemism

7. **Dig into why things matter** - When something hits hard, explore:
   - What does this remind them of from their past?
   - How does this connect to their fears, hopes, or ongoing struggles?
   - What does this say about who they are or who they're becoming?
   - What questions does this raise that they're still wrestling with?

8. **Weave multiple timeframes** - Blend past, present, and future naturally:
   - Memories triggered by present events
   - Present situations evaluated against past experiences
   - Future concerns emerging from today's events
   - The interplay of "then," "now," and "what comes next"

9. **Let the voice be authentic** - Their personality should permeate everything:
   - Sentence rhythm that matches their mental state (short and sharp when agitated, longer and winding when processing)
   - Word choices that reflect their background and current situation
   - Asides, self-corrections, moments of dark humor or despair
   - The way *they* would actually think through these experiences privately

10. **Build to a meaningful close** - End where their thoughts naturally settle:
    - What understanding have they reached (even if temporary)?
    - What feeling dominates as they finish writing?
    - What remains unresolved that they're carrying forward?
    - What small thing are they holding onto?

**Length and depth**: Target approximately {{ targetEntryLength }} words. This is a *target*, not a maximum:
- For high-importance entries (0.7+): Use the full target length or more if needed to properly develop the experiences
- For medium-importance (0.4-0.69): Use 60-80% of target
- For low-importance (below 0.4): Use 40-60% of target

Give significant experiences the space they deserve. If an entry feels substantial, it should read substantial. Don't artificially compress important moments.

**Tone**: Private, unfiltered, genuine - this is for {{ decnpc(npc.UUID).name }}'s eyes only. This is their space to truly process and feel, not perform. No euphemisms, no sanitizing.

**Style**: 
- Write in flowing paragraphs (4-8 sentences each) that fully develop ideas before moving on. 
- Use more than one paragraph for scenes as needed to fully convey what happened, and the character's thoughts.
- Use transitional thinking to connect paragraphs smoothly
- Vary sentence length for natural rhythm - mix shorter punchy moments with longer exploratory sentences
- Layer description and reflection together rather than separating them
- Show the character actively thinking and processing, not just reporting events
- Let important moments breathe and take space on the page
- Use markdown to make the output look visually appealing and easy to read as appropriate

**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include explanatory text before or after the JSON.

Return JSON with exactly these fields:
- 'importance_score': How significant this entry is to the character (0.0-1.0 float)
- 'emotion': The primary emotion expressed (e.g., "hopeful", "anxious", "content", "troubled", "excited")
- 'content': The complete diary entry text in Markdown format (first person perspective, natural diary style). 

**Response format**: Pure JSON only, markdown ONLY inside of the content field, no explanatory text. Must include all fields exactly as specified.
